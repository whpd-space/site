	<h1>LEGAL LIBRARY</h1>
	<h2> Welcome to the WHPD legal library. </h2>
	<p>Here you can find the entirety of the Interstellar Universal Statute Law - IUS Lex Penal Code.</p>
	<h3>I‎nterstellar Universal Statute Law -IUS LEX - Sec 1 - Might Makes Right</h3>
	<p>In all cases related to the dispute of legal authority IUS LEX Sec 1 shall apply. This is based on the simple
		historical truth that the RIGHT authority is assigned to the party able to exert their MIGHT in any given
		situation.</p>
	<p>Throughout history the idea of "woe to the vanquished" is vividly expressed as far back as Homer, in the hawk
		parable from Hesiod's Works and Days, and in Livy, in which the equivalent Latin phrase "vae victis" is first
		recorded.</p>
	<p>The idea, has been attributed to the History of the Peloponnesian War by the ancient historian Thucydides, who
		stated that "right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what
		they can and the weak suffer what they must."</p>
	<p>In the first chapter of Plato's Republic, Thrasymachus claims that "justice is nothing else than the interest of
		the stronger", Callicles in Gorgias argues similarly that the strong should rule the weak, as a right owed to
		their superiority.</p>
	<p>Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union campaign address (1860): "Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that
		faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it".</p>
	<p>It is understood by this governing body that the root of all laws lies in the MIGHT and ABILITY to enforce them.
	</p>
	<h3>Ignorantia Juris Non Excusat</h3>
	<p>In accordance with IUS LEX - Sec 1 - Might Makes Right it is understood that ignorance of the law is never a
		valid legal defence.</p>
	<p>As the sole body regulating wormhole space and with a number of officers very small compared to the amount of
		space under our legislation, the Interstellar Universal Statute Law or IUS LEX must be enforced regardless of
		the offenders' awareness of said law.</P>
	<p>It is expected a large portion of offenders will be unaware of The Wormhole Police's efforts due to poor
		communication by CONCORD regulated authorities.</p>
	<p>According to IUS LEX - Sec 1 however, due to a lack of higher authority in sacred Anoikis or Wormhole Space all
		offenders must answer to any officers arresting them, and will be made aware of the IUS LEX Penal Code upon
		receiving a Criminal Citation.</p>
	<H3>Criminal Procedure</H3>
	<p>The Wormhole Police Department seeks to enforce the IUS Lex as outlined in IUS Lex - sec 1 with the goal of
		protecting the natural beauty of Wormhole Space. Upon spotting a suspect performing any act prohibited under the
		IUS Lex or otherwise have probable cause, officers are permitted to perform an arrest. To ensure officer safety
		during the arrest officers are permitted to engage lethal force at any time after announcing or revealing their
		presence. Upon the completion of an arrest, the suspect will receive a criminal citation outlining their
		offense. This record will then be kept by the WHPD. if available, any dashcam footage of the arrest may be made
		public. All offences prohibited by the IUS Lex are displayed below for reference. All suspects are allowed to
		make an appeal directed to <a href="https://evewho.com/character/2114493660">Judge Grinning Idiot</a> if they
		believe their arrest was unjustified.</p>
