	<H1>OUR MISSION</H1>
	<P> The Wormhole Police are dedicated to stopping space piracy<br><br> For far too long the Empires have sent out
		their Miners, Murderers Hackers and Thieves to openly prey on ancient sites critical to the cultures of what
		they deem "Pirate Factions". This xenophobic and genocidal activity is happening without social consequence. The
		Empire Agents are given full authority to keep their knees on the necks of the innocent peoples. People like The
		Blood Raiders.<br><br> We act in total defiance of the empire's wishes to paint these cultures as
		criminal.<br><br> The factions do their best to launch a defense. Using their own forces they eliminate a fair
		number of empire thieves. It is clearly not enough. Unguarded faction sites are being decimated! These sites are
		being farmed for their mineral wealth, mined for their technology, left to evaporate in space.<br><br>
		Unfortunately, in Empire Space, all is lost in this fight! The nature of Empire Space and the hateful Concord
		"GLORY HOUNDS" prevent us from being an effective team. We have encouraged the so-called Pirate Factions to seek
		shelter under our wing in Wormhole Space.. The only space free of dirty, filthy Empire Influence. Out here the
		only rule that applies is MIGHT MAKES RIGHT.<br><br> It is estimated that one solo pilot can destroy 100 ancient
		sites in one day. Hundreds of years worth of tek, gas, ore and LIVES lost by one single pilot! It's a big job
		for a smol force but we do out best to be the shining beacon of light in a sea of darkness.<br><br> We are THE
		WORMHOLE POLICE </P>
