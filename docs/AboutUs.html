		<h2>Chief of Police Vinnegar Douchay</h2>
		<p>Vinnegar Douche (pronounced doo-shay) began life as a humble goat herder thousands of years ago. Despite now leading the
		WHPD as a godlike capsuleer, he remains devoted to his traditions. Accompanied by his microphone eating bird, Charlie,
		the Chief of Police quietly patrols wormhole space, scanning every moon for dirtbags.</p>

	<div class="officer-info">
		<h2>Officer Squizz Caphinator</h2>
		<p>
			Commander of an entirely reasonable number of alts who absolutely operate independently but somehow always arrive on
			grid at the same time. With an arsenal of websites containing what some might call “cheat codes” and others call
			“publicly available information,” he prefers preparation over panic. While others guess, Squizz already checked the
			logs, the routes, and your fit. If you see one ship, assume there are five more cloaked and a webpage open with your
			name on it.

		<h2>Officer Damoraath Sponge</h2>
		<p>
			Retired from some other military that probably still tells stories about him, this exemplary Officer makes his rounds in
			good spirits and with an endless supply of jokes that are far better than they need to be. He takes the job seriously,
			just not himself, and somehow that makes it worse for you. If he cites you, make sure you compliment the yellow
			checkered pants. It will not help your case, but it will absolutely make his day.

	<div class="officer-info">
		<h2>Officer BLiTzD86</h2>
		<p>Proudly born on the 20th moon of the 4th planet, to which he still offers regular tokes of gratitude, he serves as head
		of a sprawling family of 86 children, 2 ex-wives, and 13 ex-fiancées. Voted "Most Likely to Be Arrested by Internal
		Affairs," this Deputy is always surrounded by a cloud of appeasing fumes when on duty.

		<h2>Officer Muh Mabebu</h2>
		<p>
			Short in height, tall in automation. If it can beep, flash, or file a report, she already scripted it. Even her space
			wee woos are fully automated and probably documented. She may need a booster seat in the Tholos, but her code reaches
			everywhere. If you get cited by Muh, just know it was efficient, optimized, and its soemtimes honestly kind of
			impressive.

		<h2>Deputy 10of15</h2>
		<p> Deputy 10of15 of the Oohk Monkeystary is the softest of the WHPD members. He'll cite you and cry at the sunset at the
		same time. If he's having a really good day he'll insist that you lick his ice cream cone too. Be careful where you lick
		as this deputy might shed. </p>
