<h2>Protecting the Sanctity of J-Space</h2>
<p> Wormhole space is not simply another region of New Eden to be farmed, exploited, and discarded at will. It is a
	unique and sacred ecosystem, home to those who have chosen to embrace its dangers, navigate its shifting pathways,
	and respect the delicate balance of life within it. Unlike the rigid structures of highsec or the lawless sprawl of
	nullsec, J-space exists in a state of controlled chaos—where those who live here do so by skill, knowledge, and
	respect for the unknown. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, not everyone shares this understanding. Some see wormholes as nothing more than temporary
	ISK-printing machines, dropping in unannounced, extracting resources, and fleeing the moment they sense trouble.
	Others treat wormhole space as a convenient shortcut, rolling away connections without a second thought to those who
	depend on them. This disregard for local sovereignty and ecosystem stability is precisely why the <b>Wormhole Police
		Department (WHPD)</b> exists. </p>
